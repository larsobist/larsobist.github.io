    "TEXT": "I am Lars, currently a master's student at the Berlin Institute of Technology (BHT). Among the various areas of media informatics, I am particularly interested in frontend development and design aspects. The work 'behind' the interface, the backend, is also fascinating, as it involves developing an entire project from the ground up, shaping every layer of a project. The combination of creativity and systematic thinking in media informatics is something I find very exciting. At the end of a project, you can see what the project has become, making it enjoyable to develop new projects! I hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio, where you'll learn a lot about me and my created products. I hope you appreciate my work and feel free to get in touch!",

It aims to provide fans interested in such sports with a centralized online platform. Through a collaboration between the university and Radio Bremen, we had the opportunity to prototype this idea as part of our bachelor project. The web app's functionality and content were defined in the concept phase by our group. To further define the platform, we conducted sports and target audience identification. During the implementation phase, we performed a competitive analysis, created mood boards, and designed the platform's branding. In the design development, wireframes were initially designed and later defined more precisely by me and Yuliya Litvin using Adobe XD. Meanwhile, the rest of the team developed a prototype.",

An in-depth requirements analysis was conducted, and important foundations were established. Based on the previous results, a detailed concept of a hybrid teaching model and a digital learning management system were developed. The concept was then prototypically implemented, evaluated with test users, and finally assessed.",

      "DESCRIPTION": "Sometimes, it's worth deviating from the beaten tourist paths and exploring unfamiliar places. These lesser-known travel destinations not only offer an escape from the crowds but also provide an opportunity to discover new culinary delights and immerse oneself in the local culture. Together with Thao Nguyen, we created a platform that showcases food specialties from around the world, closely tied to noteworthy locations. Once the design concept was established, we initiated the design process. The hand-drawn wireframes were later refined in Adobe XD and then prototypically programmed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This platform was developed to be optimized for web, tablet, and mobile devices.",

      "DESCRIPTION": "ESHOP YTL is a small online shop developed in collaboration with Thao Nguyen and Yuliya Litvin. Customers and employees have their own accounts with different rights. When not logged in, users can view all items. Once logged in, a customer can add items to the shopping cart, edit it, and make purchases. After a purchase, the customer receives an invoice. A logged-in employee can view and add users, add new items, increase the stock of an item, and view the entire history of all items as well as an individual item's history. We created the E-Shop with a graphical user interface that runs on a server, allowing multiple users to use the E-Shop simultaneously.",
