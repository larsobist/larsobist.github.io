    "TEXT": "I am Lars, currently a master's student at the Berlin Institute of Technology (BHT). Among the various areas of media informatics, I am particularly interested in frontend development and design aspects. The work 'behind' the interface, the backend, is also fascinating, as it involves developing an entire project from the ground up, shaping every layer of a project. The combination of creativity and systematic thinking in media informatics is something I find very exciting. At the end of a project, you can see what the project has become, making it enjoyable to develop new projects! I hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio, where you'll learn a lot about me and my created products. I hope you appreciate my work and feel free to get in touch!",

It aims to provide fans interested in such sports with a centralized online platform. Through a collaboration between the university and Radio Bremen, we had the opportunity to prototype this idea as part of our bachelor project. The web app's functionality and content were defined in the concept phase by our group. To further define the platform, we conducted sports and target audience identification. During the implementation phase, we performed a competitive analysis, created mood boards, and designed the platform's branding. In the design development, wireframes were initially designed and later defined more precisely by me and Yuliya Litvin using Adobe XD. Meanwhile, the rest of the team developed a prototype.",

An in-depth requirements analysis was conducted, and important foundations were established. Based on the previous results, a detailed concept of a hybrid teaching model and a digital learning management system were developed. The concept was then prototypically implemented, evaluated with test users, and finally assessed.",
